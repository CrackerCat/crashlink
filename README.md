Pure Python HashLink bytecode parser/disassembler/decompiler/modding tool

## Features

- Pure Python with zero dependencies, integrates nicely in a lot of places (IDAPython compatible!)
- Allows values to be externally modified and reserialised through a scriptable interface
- A very nice little CLI with [hlbc](https://github.com/Gui-Yom/hlbc)-compatible mode.

## Credits

- Thank you to [Gui-Yom](https://github.com/Gui-Yom) for writing hlbc and for maintaining documentation on the HashLink bytecode format, as well as for providing tests and helping me during development.
- Thank you to [Haxe Foundation](https://haxe.org/) for creating the HashLink VM and the Haxe programming language.
- And a big thank you to you, dear user, for being at least partially interested in this project.
